# Code Challenge 7

Congrats on making it to your seventh and final code challenge!

## INSTRUCTIONS
Fork this repository and clone it to your computer. Run `npm install` and `npm start`.

There is no database -- all data will be generated by a user, and refreshing will reset the app. No axios, no server.

There are 3 views. Each view needs to be hooked up to redux, with actions and reducers being defined by you. Your reducers (you will need multiple) should all live in the `buttonsReducer.js` file. Don't forget to combine them!

Fulfill the requirements below:

### SECTION ONE - Speed

This component is our interface for speed. We need to display the current speed, along with changing it appropriately when we click 'Increase' or 'Decrease'. There is no need for any local state.

### SECTION TWO - Passengers

This component is our interface for checking in Passengers. Type in the name. On click of the button, the name should be entered into the list. The list should be displayed and have a `default entry of your name`.

### SECTION THREE - Dashboard

This component is our dashboard. It should display our current speed and the number of passengers currently on board. 

### SUPER SECRET

ONLY AFTER YOU COMPLETE THE SECTIONS ABOVE  
go to http:localhost:3000/4
